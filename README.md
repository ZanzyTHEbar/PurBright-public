# Purbright Controller README

This repo is dedicated to the **Purbright Controller**, an automated system for purifying cat litter air.

# WHAT IS THIS PROJECT

This project is dedicated to designing PCB and programming files to bring the Purbright product to mass manufacturing.

# Things to Do

**__Hardware__**

- [x] Formulate project as PlatformIO
- [x] Integrate the PCB schematic layout
- [x] Integrate a BOM parts list for PCB
- [x] Integrate a Pick and Place file
- [ ] Integrate Panelised PCB gerber files
- [ ] Integrate SPI SRAM chip instead of SD Card
- [ ] Integrate speakers for audio feedback

**__Software__**

- [x] Implement proper memory management
- [ ] Implement proper error handling&logging
- [ ] Implement proper documentation
- [ ] Implement proper debugging for testing
- [ ] Add custom sounds for speakers
- [x] implement code as proper custom library
- [ ] implement dual core system archtecture
        --> Networking on one core and Application code on the other (esp32 is dual core)
